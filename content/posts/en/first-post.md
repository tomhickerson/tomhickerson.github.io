I'm starting to work on this blog again to get away from the WordPress way of working with things, that is, to have someone else set up the MySQL and PHP and hope it's all the right version and away we go.
Working with Github Pages has helped me understand Git a little more, like using things like [git rm](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-rm) and [git submodule](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-submodule).
