As of the writing of this post, the July 4th holidays are in the rear view mirror and we're on our way to the 2024 US Presidential Election in a few more months.  Overall, things are still the same here; we're all still alive, some of my colleagues have moved around but I'm not allowed to say where.

So, what's been happening?

### What I've Watched

I started off the year watching [True Detective Season 4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_true) and [Monsieur Spade](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14203572/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_monsi).  True Detective spawned an amazing first season, and then went off a cliff for many years before giving the viewer what they really wanted; give Jodie Foster a badge and a gun again and deliver *Silence of the Lambs on Ice*.  Which it did.

Clive Owen in Monsieur Spade was a great juxtopose to True Detective, in summertime post-WW2 France with noirish twists here and there.  Maybe the ending wrapped itself up a little too neatly, but sure, I'd see a second season of that.

I then discovered a guilty pleasure; [Law and Order Toronto Criminal Intent](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27954448/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_law%2520and%2520order%2520toronto).  As if you couldn't put more words in the title.  I'm surprised they didn't get to a case involving hockey until episode 8.  This led me to go back and pick up some other [Law and Order](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098844/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_law%2520and%2520), and even take another look at [NCIS](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364845/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_ncis).

This all leads up to what everyone is watching this last month: [The Acolyte](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12262202/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_6_nm_1_in_0_q_the%2520acolyt).  After the first episode I was going to start comparing this to Marvel's Secret Invasion but no, this is becoming *way way worse*.  At least with Secret Invasion you had some standout performances.  I'm not an acting coach or a writing coach, but killing off Carrie-Anne Moss in the first ten - okay, maybe five - minutes of your opener stoked the ire of many many fanboys, and now it's like looking at a train crash in slow motion; there's absolutely no chance anyone can look away.  Only two more episodes to go...

### Pleasant Surprises

So I finally watched [The Batman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520batm) and [Mars Express](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26915336/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_mars%2520exp) and really enjoyed both.  I've also been reading more; mostly due to Good Omens' success, I started to pick up [Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld).  He's Douglas Adams with a decent work ethic, and most of his books don't disappoint.

I'm also reading [Titanium Noir](https://www.amazon.com/Titanium-Noir-novel-Nick-Harkaway-ebook/dp/B0B9WPF9NQ/) right now and it's great.  Go read it now, if you haven't.
