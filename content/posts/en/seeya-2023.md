### Seeya 2023, wouldn't want to be ya (again)

I was going to post a longer rant about what was good and bad about this year, but honestly [the bombing of the center of Kharkiv last night](https://gwaramedia.com/en/russia-massively-attacks-kharkiv-with-missiles-22-wounded/) has made everything I write sound pathetic.  So I'll just leave you with this for now.

The best thing I watched in 2023 was [Poker Face with Natasha Lyonne](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14269590/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_poker).

The thing I'm the most proud about in 2023 was my ability to stick with a habit:

That's about it.  Everything else was meh.  Happy New Year, and let's hope 2024 is a better one.
