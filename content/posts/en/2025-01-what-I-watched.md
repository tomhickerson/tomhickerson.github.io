I'll start to post 'what I watched/read' posts for the last few years here, just to give you an idea of what kind of media I liked to watch in 2024.  The TL;DR of it: lots of animation, some Terry Pratchett, a movie here and there when I had the time.  I may hyperlink these in the future.  Sometimes I add a review.
