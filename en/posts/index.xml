<p>I originally started with <a href="https://chrisjhart.com/Creating-A-Simple-Free-Blog-Hugo/">a short article</a> about deploying to Github with Hugo, however a few things had changed since then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugo itself now uses a &lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;hugo.toml&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; file instead of &lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;config.toml&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;</li>
<li>Github now offers a one-click support for Hugo actions, so there&rsquo;s no need to roll your own Action &lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;.yaml&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; file</li>
</ul>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s worth it to research your theme locally for a while, before pushing anything to Github.  I rushed that a bit and had to change themes mid-stream, but am now getting it all working.</p>
<p>Working with Github Pages has also helped me understand Git a little more, like using things like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-rm">git rm</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-submodule">git submodule</a>.</p>
